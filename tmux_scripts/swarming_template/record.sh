# IN GENERAL, DON'T RECORD CAMERAS
#
# If you want to record cameras, create a copy of this script
# and place it at your tmux session.
#
# Please, seek an advice of a senior researcher of MRS about
# what can be recorded. Recording too much data can lead to
# ROS communication hiccups, which can lead to eland, failsafe
# or just a CRASH.
