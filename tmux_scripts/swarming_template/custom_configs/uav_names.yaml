# 1. This list is used by NimbroNetwork for mutual communication of the UAVs
#    The names of the robots have to match hostnames described in /etc/hosts.
#    Update the /etc/hosts by running:
#
#     uav_core/miscellaneous/dotssh/generate_ssh_config.sh
#
# 2. This list is used by MpcTracker for mutual collision avoidance of the UAVs.
#    The names should match the true "UAV_NAMES" (the topic prefixes).
#
# 3. This list is a GENERAL LIST containing all possible UAVs we have.
#    However, this is suboptimal but at least it provides some form of functionality.
#    THUS everyone should have a custom config at its tmux script, containing just
#    the UAVs that are going to be flying in the same area. You can add the custom config
#    by adding:
#
#     config_uav_names:=~/custom_configs/uav_names.yaml
#
#    to the core.launch and nimbro.launch.
